Where should you &#10;install the X-Ray daemon? &#10;V Create a separate Docker image to run the X-Ray daemon. &#10;x Update the Docker image to include the X-Ray daemon and provision the new version of the application. &#10;X Install the X-Ray daemon on the same Docker container where the application code is running. SELECTED &#10;x Install the X-Ray daemon on the EC2 instance where your Docker containers are running. &#10;EXPLANATION: &#10;In Amazon ECS, create a Docker image that runs the X-Ray daemon, upload t to a Docker image repository, and then deploy t to &#10;your Amazon ECS cluster.

One of the easiest &#10;options is to provide more I/O throughput than can provision for a single EBS volume. This can be done by striping using &#10;RAID 0. You can join multiple gp2, iol, st 1, or scl volumes together in a RAID 0 configuration to provide parallel read/Write &#10;performance. The second option is to choose an EC2 instance type that supports EBS optimization. This ensures that network &#10;traffic will not contend with traffic between your instance and your EBS volumes. The final correct choice is only related to &#10;HDD based EBS volumes. When create a snapshot of a Throughput Optimized HDD (st 1) or Cold HDD (SCI) volume, &#10;performance may drop as far as the volume's baseline value while the snapshot is in progress. This behaviour is specific to &#10;these volume types. Therefore 5.0-1 should ensure that scheduled snapshots are carried at times of low usage. The one option &#10;on the list which is entirely incorrect is the one that states &quot;Never use HDD volumes, always ensure that SSDs are used&quot; as the &#10;question first states &quot;In addition to choosing the correct EBS volume type for your specific task&quot;. HDDs may well be suitable to &#10;certain tasks and therefore they should not be discounted because they may not have have the highest specification on &#10;pa &#10;2Sb806da-9f4c-4aa &#10;01 &#10;RESOURCES &#10;Amazon EBS features &#10;02:00 &#10;Amazon EBS Volume Performance on &#10;Linux Instances &#10;STATS &#10;• You spent 01:33 on this question &#10;Desktop &#10;1&amp;26 AM "

It &#10;has already adopted a plan to execute the various phases of the CI/CD pipeline from continuous &#10;integration to continuous deployment. There are now discussions around restructuring the team make-up &#10;to implement a CI/CD environment. How would you recommend creating developer teams as a best &#10;practice to support this change in the long run? &#10;x Use Codepipeline to manage your CI/CD environment and assign team members to own different phases within your &#10;Codepipeline. &#10;x Hire an external consulting firm to build and manage the pipeline. Provide them with the proper IAM roles to access your AWS &#10;environment. &#10;X Set up one team to own an operate all components of the CI/CD pipeline to consolidate tasks and improve &#10;efficiency. SELECTED &#10;Set up an application team to develop applications. Set up an infrastructure team to create and configure the infrastructure to &#10;run the applications. Set up a tools team to build and manage the CI/CD pipeline. &#10;EXPLANATION: &#10;AWS recommends organizing three developer teams for implementing a CI/CD environment: an application team, an infrastructure &#10;team, and a tools team. This organization represents a set of best practices that have been developed and applied in fast-moving &#10;startups, large enterprise organizations, and in Amazon tself. The teams should be no larger than groups that two pizzas can feed, &#10;or about 10-12 people. This follows the communication rule that meaningful conversations hit limits as group sizes increase and &#10;lines of communication multiply. Hiring an external consulting firm will not be beneficial in the long run. Setting up a single team is &#10;not best practice. AWS Codepipeline is a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for fast and reliable application and &#10;infrastructure updates and not used for team structuring. &#10;pa &#10;1&amp;27 AM &#10;Desktop "

On the other hand, a scan &#10;operation reads every item in a table. A filter expression parameter can be used to narrow down the results based on some &#10;required criteria (Cost of the item in this case).

To process payments, the application needs to perform a write operation on a &#10;sequence of items, and roll back and reverse all operations in case of any one faulty operation. What is &#10;the best method to accomplish this requirement? &#10;V Use the TransactWriteltems operation. SELECTED &#10;x Update the application to manage and perform roll-back operations. &#10;x Use the BatchWriteltem operation. &#10;x DynamoD3 does not support atomic transactions. use relational database (such as ROS) that supports atomic transactions. &#10;EXPLANATION: &#10;DynamoDB transactions feature provides ability to group multiple items into a single atomic transaction and perform all-or-nothing &#10;coordinated operations. This can be done programmatically using the TransactWriteltems operation. The BatchWriteltem operation &#10;does not meet the question requirements as t does not guarantee that the actions will be performed on all items as a single atomic &#10;coordinated operation. It is possible that only some of the actions in the batch succeed while the others do not. updating the &#10;payments application is not the ideal solution. It requires application code change and tracking all connected operations and &#10;reversing them as required is not trivial to implement. using the native transaction ability provided by DynamoDB is a better option. &#10;pa &#10;How It Works &#10;STAT s &#10;• You spent 01:09 on this question &#10;• You flagged this question &#10;• You changed your answer to this &#10;question &#10;Desktop "

There is no requirement that jobs have to be &#10;processed in the order in which they are added to the queue; however, duplicate jobs must not appear in &#10;the queue. How best can these requirements be implemented? &#10;x Lock messages once they are added to the queue to prevent duplicates from being added. &#10;x Implement a standard SQS queue. &#10;x Use DynamoD3 to track what jobs are in the queue. Check DynamoDB before adding a new job to the queue to ensure t is not a &#10;duplicate. &#10;V Implement a FIFO SQS queue. SELECTED &#10;EXPLANATION: &#10;SQS FIFO queues, while guaranteeing message delivery order, also support a Message Deduplication ID. This can be used to detect &#10;and ignore duplicate messages within a 5-minute deduplication interval. Standard SQS queues do not have this feature. using &#10;DynamoDB to trackjobs could also meet the requirements, but would require the organization to manage the duplication detection &#10;process themselves; thus, t is not the best solution. &#10;EXAM DOMAIN &#10;Message Deduplication ID in Message &#10;Deduplication ID &#10;STAT s &#10;• You spent 04:37 on this question &#10;Desktop &#10;AM "

Which of the &#10;following statements best describes a canary deployment? &#10;x All instances of the original application are stopped, after which new instances of the application are started up in their place. &#10;During the transition, there is a short period of downtime. &#10;x A new version of the application is deployed alongside the existing version. Once the new version is ready to handle traffic, all &#10;traffic is redirected to t. &#10;V A new version of the application is deployed alongside the existing version. A proportion of application's traffic is directed &#10;to the new application. It after a given number of minutes, metrics demonstrate that the new version is performing &#10;correctly, the remainder of the traffic is moved to the new version. SELECTED &#10;x Each instance of the original application is taken out of service one at a time and replaced with the new version of the &#10;application. During the deployment, traffic is sent to a mix of the original and new versions. &#10;EXPLANATION: &#10;A canary deploy allows us to gain confidence in an application update by initially just releasing t to a subsection of users. Once we &#10;are satisfied that the update is working as expected, the update is then rolled out to the remaining users. The concept of a canary &#10;deployment is covered in the AWS Well-Architected Framework, and is a feature of API Gateway.

We need a &#10;Global Secondary Index for a different partition key because a local secondary index must be created at the time you create a table. &#10;To retrieve only the time of interest, the ReportingPeriod must be the sort key.

Which AWS service should you run this &#10;application on in order to provide the most reliable and cost effective solution? &#10;x Create an ECS Cluster and run the application as a service on that cluster &#10;x Create an Auto Scaling Group for an EC2 instance. Run the application on that instance with crontab set to 1 hour &#10;x Create a CloudFront endpoint and point t to an SS bucket. Run the application from that bucket &#10;V Make the application a Lambda function and create a Scheduled Event Trigger set to 1 hour SELECTED &#10;EXPLANATION: &#10;The question states that the application is to run once every hour, which immediately means we should be looking for an option &#10;which only utilizes resources when needed. Lambda is the only option in the above list which bills you only when an application is &#10;running. The EC2 and ECS options will bill for all resources, regardless of whether the application is running or not. SS should be &#10;discounted because although you can host static Websites, you cannot run Python applications from t. &#10;pa "

Originally, the function ran outside of a VPC, &#10;but after the update, it now connects to a VPC. Since the change, part of the function that accesses a &#10;HTTPS endpoint on a third-party website has stopped working. What is the most likely cause of the &#10;Lambda function no longer being able to access the third-party endpoint? &#10;x The third-party web server does not support access from a Lambda function that is connected to a VPC. Contact the third-party &#10;to request they create a VPC endpoint. &#10;The Lambda function no longer has any route out to the Internet. A NAT Gateway, and associated route, should be added. &#10;x It is not possible to access external web services from a Lambda function that is connected to a VPC. The amend should be &#10;rolled back. &#10;X The Lambda's execution role does not have the required permissions. Attach the AWS Managed AWSLambdalnternetAccess &#10;policy to the Lambda's execution role. SELECTED &#10;EXPLANATION: &#10;If a Lambda function is connected to a VPC, t must have a route out to the internet via a NAT Gateway or NAT instance in order to &#10;connect to external services. You must also ensure that the relevant Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists are configured &#10;to allow the required ports. From the perspective of the third-party web server, a request that originates from a Lambda function is &#10;no different from any other request, so no changes are needed. Lambda functions connect to a VPC via an Elastic Network Interface. &#10;Security controls are therefore managed by network Security Groups and NACLs, not IAM policies. The function's execution role &#10;does, however, need permissions to initially connect to the VPC. This can be done with the AWS Managed &#10;AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole policy, for example. &#10;pa &#10;RESO &#10;Configuring a Lambda Function to &#10;Access Resources in a VPC &#10;STAT s &#10;• You spent 05:50 on this question &#10;• You flagged this question &#10;Desktop "

What would be the recommended &#10;subnet for hosting an RDS database instance? &#10;x Subnetl &#10;x Subnet3 &#10;Subnet2 &#10;X Subnet4 SELECTED &#10;EXPLANATION: &#10;Security best practice would state that RDS Database instances should be deployed to a private subnet. A private subnet would only &#10;have private IP's with no direct access to the public internet. Outbound connectivity would be provided via a NAT gateway. Thus, &#10;Subnet2 is a suitable choice for deploying RDS instances as t is characterized as a private subnet. Subnetl has direct connectivity to &#10;the public internet via the Internet gateway. Thus, t is characterized as a public subnet and would not be recommended location for &#10;deploying databases. Bastion hosts allow direct inbound connections from public internet. This means that Subnet3 would not be a &#10;good choice to host databases. Lastly, Subnet4 contains NSG rule that allows inbound connectivity from the public internet on the &#10;database port (1433). This makes t a poor candidate to host databases. &#10;pa &#10;VPC with Public and Private Subnets &#10;(NAT) &#10;STAT s &#10;• You spent 03:32 on this question &#10;Desktop "

Your company also has resources &#10;running on AWS. Your admin has created IAM roles and an identity broker that sits between your corporate &#10;users and your AWS resources to manage the authentication and authorization process without needing to re- &#10;create all your users as IAM users in AWS. Your CISO asked you to summarize the AWS identity federation &#10;process to ensure compliance with your applications' security. Which of the following statements correctly &#10;describes the authentication process? &#10;x The identity broker application has permissions to access the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to request temporary security &#10;credentials. The enterprise user accesses the identity broker application. The identity broker application authenticates the users &#10;against the corporate identity store. Enterprise users can get a temporary URL that gives them access to the AWS APIs or the &#10;Management Console. &#10;The enterprise user accesses the identity broker application. The identity broker application authenticates the users against the &#10;corporate identity store. The identity broker application has permissions to access the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to request &#10;temporary security credentials. Enterprise users can get a temporary URL that gives them access to the AWS APIs or the Management &#10;Console. SELKTED &#10;X The enterprise user accesses the identity broker application. Enterprise users can get a temporary URL that gives them access to the &#10;AWS APIs or the Management Console. The identity broker application authenticates the users against the corporate identity store. &#10;The identity broker application has permissions to access the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to request temporary security &#10;credentials. &#10;X The enterprise user accesses the identity broker application. The identity broker application authenticates the users against the &#10;corporate identity store. Enterprise users can get a temporary URL that gives them access to the AWS APIs or the Management &#10;Console. The identity broker application has permissions to access the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to request temporary &#10;security credentials. &#10;EXPLANATION: &#10;Users might already have identities outside of AWS, such as in your corporate directory. However, those users might need to work with &#10;AWS resources (or work with applications that access those resources). If so, these users also need AWS security credentials in order to &#10;make requests to AWS. The process can be summarized as follows: I. The enterprise user accesses the identity broker application. 2. &#10;The identity broker application authenticates the users against the corporate identity store. 3. The identity broker application has &#10;permissions to access the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to request temporary security credentials. 4. Enterprise users can get a &#10;temporary URL that gives them access to the AWS APIs or the Management Console. A sample identity broker application for use with &#10;Microsoft Active Directory is provided by AWS. Details on page 22 of the URL link. &#10;pa "
